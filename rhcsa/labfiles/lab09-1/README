=== LAB 9: Managing Process

OBJECTIVE:

In this lab, you will practice finding poorly behaving processes and shut them
down.

STEPS: 

You can do these steps on the host or any virtual machine.

1.  Open a terminal and run:

      while true; do echo "Are we there yet?"; sleep 2; done

    The previous command will echo a message to the screen every two seconds.

2.  Stop the previous command without closing the terminal
    a: ctrl + c 
3.  Now run this in your terminal:

      (while true; do ls -LR / > /dev/null 2>&1 ; done) &

    You should get a prompt back right away.

4.  Figure out which process is using most of your CPU and terminate the process.
    a: top | grep ls. pid = 13411
5.  Read the man page for "ps" to find out how to change the output so that only
    this information is displayed about every process:

      The user running the process 
      The process ID 
      The percent of CPU the process is using 
      The percent of memory the process is using
      The command line used to start the process,pid

      a: ps -o user,pid,pcpu,pmem,command

6.  How would you sort the output of ps by total CPU time the process has used?

    a: ps u --sort -time
7.  What do you think this command is showing you:

      echo $$

      a: bash pid

8.  How would you change the output of "top"?
    
    a: < or >
    a: capital E to change memory size
    a: 1 to show stats for each cpu
    a: m to sort by memory



NOTE: jobs -l will return jobs and PID
