# The CompTIA Network+ virtual lab environment

# Getting Started
> NOTE: This virtual lab environment is only working on Mac OS X and Debian (Buster)

## Configure the virtualization environment for a specific lab (Network+)
If you haven't already done so, run the ```setup``` script in the parent directory with ```networkplus``` as the only argument to setup this virtual lab environment.  See the ```README.md``` in [demo](https://github.com/dmbrownlee/demo) for more details.

> On either Linux or Mac:  
> ```cd ~/demo && ./setup networkplus```  

Once the setup has completed successfully, you should reboot the host before attempting to use GNS3.

## Using GNS3
TODO: document using GNS3 and the labs

# Happy Learning!
